# What are Vaporwave aesthetics?

[Vaporwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiUps9cQZd4) and aesthetics are two different things that were blended together by someone on the internet for everyone's enjoyment. Vaporwave is a style of music centered around 80s and 90s smooth jazz sounds. The visual component, "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", include Japanese lettering, soft pastel color schemas, classical statues, 8os and 90s computer perihelia. Mixing the music and visuals together, creates an unique experince, known as Vaporwave ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ.
